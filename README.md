# RNA-folding
This Java program, RNAfolding, reads RNA sequences from an input file, performs dynamic programming to find optimal secondary structures based on RNA base pairing rules (A-U, C-G), and outputs the structure along with the number of base pairs. It handles multiple sequences, sorts and displays base pairs, and concludes with a signature message.
